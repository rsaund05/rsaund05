- 🌝 Hi, I’m Robert Saunders @rsaund05
- 🤔 I’m interested in Full Stack development, w/ NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS, React-Native, etc.
- ☎️ I am also aspiring to be a network engineer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything Javascript/webdev! I was never offered a web developemnt course in Unversity, so I need to keep up with the kids nowadays! But I am a student of the world, I always find opportunities to learn new ideas and concepts every day.
